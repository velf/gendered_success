# Gendered Success in Developer Careers

## Problem
While women have been shown to make vital contributions to the collective intelligence of teams, to collective intelligence of a team (Wooley-Williams et al., 2010), they are also marginalized in many respects. (Gill, 2002; Terrell et al., 2016) In project-based creative fields investing in social capital by sharing knowledge with other experts is an important aspect of a successful career, and men seem to do a better job at it. (Lutter, 2015) To test this hypothesis in IT, we analyzed the paths to success for men and women using their activity traces on GitHub. 

## Data Collection
Our primary data source is GitHub  the most popular online Open Source community, which is a modern platform for the development of social and knowledge capital (Bonaccorsi and Rossi, 2003). The empirical basis of this work is a data set acquired via githubarchive.org about the activities on the social coding platform GitHub, encompassing the various types of events that took place between 2009 and 2016. 
To collect information about users’ name, e-mail address, location, organizations, number of followers, number of people they follow, number of public repositories and the date they joined GitHub, we sent calls to the official GitHub  users API  

## Gender Recognition
Since users do not list their gender directly, we infer each person's gender using their first names. This is a commonly and successfully used method in Western societies (Hannak et al, 2017) In this work, we relied on the US baby name dataset (SSA 2016).  Due to some names being used for both males and females, we assign a probability of being male to each candidate based on the fraction of times their first name was assigned to a male baby in the name dataset. The bimodal shape of this probability distribution, sharply peaking at 0 and 1, allows us to binaries the values using the thresholds 0.1 and 0.9: If the probability is less than 0.1 or equal we assign the user as female, if it is higher than 0.9 or equal we assign as male, otherwise unknown. 

### Gender Recognition Summary

| Probability                        | Gender   | Sample Size  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| P <= 0.1                           | female   | 180 000      |
| No name available or 0.1 < P < 0.9 | unknown  | 6.2 million  |
| P >= 0.9                           | male     | 1.4 million  |



We used collaboration activity to conceptualize individual careers. After filtering for users with at least 10 actions we created stratified samples of each gender group, With 10,000 male, female, and unknown users. This short summary shows results of the first smaple.


## Career Path Identification


For each repository, GitHub auto-detects the main language of every repository based on ts linguist library. We extracted more than 100 different programming languages, and kept the 20 most common ones. Github (2017)
Programming is a very diverse field, with many different career tracks, such as frontend and backend development, data science or system engineering. Each field has its own favored language combinations, for instance data scientist are more likely to have projects in Python, R, SQL, Jupyter Notebooks and Julia.
We used Principal Component Analysis to identify the correlation structure within the languages and identify unique career traits. We used Scipy’s PCA.decomposiation package with Varimax Rotation to identify independent factors. Pedragosa et al (2011) We ran the the PCA analysis on each database, then use the least square criteria to extract the factors and compare them.

Correaltion matrix shows the "importance" of each language in the given components. Positive correlation means that users who have a repository in the given language are more likely to contribute in the given field, negative means they are less likely. We identified 6 main components; 1) Frontend development (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby), 2) Developers using Ruby mainly for backend problems (strong postive Ruby and quite negative JavaScript), 3) Backend Development with high activity in Java, 4) Data Science (Python, Jupyter Notebook, R, C++), 5) iOS development (Objective C, Swift) and 6) PHP enthusiastics with Frontend focus (PHP,CSS).

## Maleness

We adapted an approach pioneered by Wachs and co-authors (Wachs et al. 2017) to operationalize the extent to which someone’s behavior follows a gendered pattern, using the resulting continuous variable to consider a continuum, rather than binary, notion of gendered behavior. For measuring gendered behavior, we used a a random forest model to predict the gender of a user using their collaboration history, activity, and field they working on. The variable importance plot givse us a measure of how gendered a given kind of activity orfield is.

### Variable Importance

Our final model has a mdoerate accuracy (AUC=0.71), menaing there is no perfect classfication based on career tracks, user activity and collaboration history to predict gender. We also run a logistc regression model to understand the sign of the correlation between the independent variables and each language, for more details check <img src="gender_prediction_logit" alt="here" class="inline"/>. Both the Random FOrest and the logit model revealed that gender homophily is more likely among women, the number of female collaborators is the most important indicator of gender on GitHub.


### Gender and Success

On GitHub the number of stars on users’ own repositories defines success. We used the gender prediction results (maleness) to understand the correlation between success and gendered behavior. Here we call successful a developer if s/he has at least one star, (less than 20 percent of active users has at least 1 star.) 


<img src="maleness_success.png" alt="hi" class="inline"/>


Maleness is positively related with success, but female developers are systematically less successful, even if they have highly male behaviors. (Red line is always under the blue one.) To understand the effect of gendered behavior we ran 3 logistic regression models, 1)

We ca conclude that women are more likely to collaborate with each other But are more likely to succeed if they adopt a collaboration and activity behavior that is typical of men. For instance, they are more likely to be successful if they collaborate less with other women.


## Closure
Research shows that in a majority-minority setting the marginalized group should avoid closing itself into cohesive groups, and needs to invest into diverse collaborations to be successful in long term (Lutter, 2015). An important reason why this work is innovative is that it one of the few gendered studies which aim to computationally understand causes and consequences of female marginalization in technology. We are also able to distill our findings and offer practical advice for young professionals.
